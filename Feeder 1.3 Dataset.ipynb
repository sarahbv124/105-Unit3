    "Now that the csv file is in, the only information on the file that is needed is the data for North Carolina. In order to show information from only from North Carolina, you will need to filter only that portion of the dataset. This is done by using logical (true or false) conditions with nested square brackets. In these nested square brackets, there will be both inner brackets and outer brackets. Outside of both brackets, you will enter **ds**. In the very inner bracket, you will enter the word **State** in quotations, making sure the s in state is capitalized. The information stored in the outer bracket will be written as **ds == \"NC\"**. The inner bracket will be placed right between the ds and the double equal signs. The order should be **ds**, then an open bracket and **ds** again with another open bracket (this represents the inner bracket), the word **State** written in quotations, a closed bracket (closing the inner bracket), two equal signs, the letters **NC** written in quotations and another closed bracket (closing the outer bracket).
