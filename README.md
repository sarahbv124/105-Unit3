# Physical Inactivity Regarding Exercise Opportunities

This repository examines the correlation between the physical inactivity rate in North Carolina and if the access to exercise opportunities available in each county in the state has any effect on the physical inactivity rate between the years 2014 and 2015.

## What Does this Repository Contain

This repository is organized into different folders. One of the folders contains detailed steps and guides on the python basics and how the specific data being used was contained from a dataset using the PythonLab. The other folder contains all of the information on the physical inactivity and the access to exercise opportunities retreived from the dataset, which was made using the PythonLab and [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/). 

## Data Source

The dataset that was used to retreive this information came from the [Research Hub in the Davis Library](https://library.unc.edu/data/) located in UNC's campus and the dataset contains various health related information from counties all across the United States

## Importance of Physical Inactivity on Health

By creating this subset, the improvement of health in different counties in North Carolina can be sought for based on how much a lack of exercise opportunities is playing a factor on one's inability to seek to be healthy or become healthier. 

## Data Visualization of North Carolina Health Rates
The data visualizations for the subset of the County Health Data includes only information from North Carolina and the relationship between the amount of physical activity in each North Carolina County to the amount of availability and access opportunities that are in store for the people
