    "Python is a general-purpose programming language that has become popular for data and text analysis. Python can be easier to learn than other languages because it emphasizes (human) readability and flexibility. Python is the second most used language on GitHub; this means you'll find packages (sets of functionality developed by other users) to use Python for a wide variety of problems and tasks.\n",

    "If you haven't worked with a programming language before, learning Python will introduce you to methods used in many programming languages, making it easier to learn other languages like Java and R later on."
